## Overview
The assignment is to pick a person and create a tribute page for them.

### The challenge

  -1  Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements

  =2  You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")

  -3  You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div

  -4  Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"

  -5  Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div

  -6  You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page

  -7  You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab

  -8  Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size

  -9  Your img element should be centered within its parent element

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
