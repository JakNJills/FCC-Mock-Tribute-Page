          Suprisingly Stephen Curry was not a highly sought after recruit. Towards the end of his high school career Stephen was only rated as an 3 star recruit. The highest rating a high school player can get is 5 and the lowest is 2. So being ranked so low amgonst other players across the country did not land him any scholarship offers. Curry had his eyes set on Virginia Tech to follow in his father's footsteps but after a try-out with the team he was only offered a walk-on role. However Steph knew he needed to go to a school where he would be guaranteed playing time if he wanted to make his dreams of going pro come true. It is no secret many colleges over looked Curry because of his physical appearance. At the end of his high school career, Stephen Curry stood at only 6'0 feet tall and weighed under 200 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr> which many deemed unsuitable for the cutthroat and physically demanding nature of college basketball. Which left his choices of colleges very slim. Stephen Curty agreed to join the Davidson College Wildcat basketball team. Where he began to blossom and show his true potential. In his freshmen year he accomplished many things. He set the record for most points(730)scored in a season by a freshmen at Davidson. Named <dif><abbr title="Southern Conference">SoCon</abbr></dif> Player of the Month in November, February, and March. Steph would help his team a bid to the <abbr title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</abbr> College Baskketball Tournament. Even though the team lost to Maryland in the first round Curry was able to drop 30 points. He is also named to the <abbr title="second">2nd</abbr> All American team and nominated for the ESPY's breakout athlete award. Safe to say Curry had put the entire nation on alert and watch.

          But despite a pretty great first season there were no calls from interested professional teams. Curry continued on to his second season as Wildcat. In his second year Curry once again helped his team make it to the NCAA College Basketball tournament. Where they blazed through the first three rounds with three upsets against higher ranking opponents, <dfn><abbr title="number">No.</abbr></dfn>7 Gonzaga, <dfn><abbr title="number">No.</abbr></dfn>2 Georgetown, and <dfn><abbr title="number">No.</abbr></dfn>3 Wisconsin. Only being kept out of the Final Four round by a 2 point loss to Kansas in the Elite Eight round.
