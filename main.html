          Suprisingly Stephen Curry was not a highly sought after recruit. Towards the end of his high school career Stephen was only rated as an 3 star recruit. The highest rating a high school player can get is a 5 star ranking and the lowest is 2. So being ranked so low amgonst other players across the country did not land him any basketball scholarship offers. Every top and middle ranked school passed him. Curry had his eyes set on Virginia Tech to follow in his father's footsteps but after a try-out with the team he was only offered a walk-on role. Walk-on roles are not a terrible thing and many great Sport's Athletes were once walk-ons at their former university. However Steph knew he needed to go to a school where he would be guaranteed playing time if he wanted to make his dreams of going pro come true. It is no secret many colleges over looked Curry because of his physical appearance. At the end of his high school career,  Stephen Curry stood at only 6'0 feet tall and weighed under 200 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr> which many deemed unsuitable for the cutthroat and physically demanding nature of college basketball. Which left his choices of colleges very slim. Stephen Curty agreed to join the Davidson College Wildcat basketball team. Where he began to blossom and show his true potential.
