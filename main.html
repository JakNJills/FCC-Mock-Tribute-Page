          Wardell Stephen Curry &#8545;<span class="sr-only">the second</span> or Steph Curry, as we know him, is an active <abbr>nba</abbr> Player. He was born in 1983 in Akron, Ohio. The same town as NBA SuperStar, LeBron James. Steph is the eldest son of Wardell "Dell" Curry Sr., a former <abbr>nba</abbr> player, and his wife, Sonya Curry. He grew up with two younger siblings, Seth and Sydel Curry. Steph and his siblings grew up in <abbr>nba</abbr> Arenas. Dell Curry played for three different teams during his tenure in the <abbr>nba</abbr>. The Curry kids lived every young basketball players' dream childhood. Stephen and Seth have reminisced in interviews about their life growing up with a pro-dad. They had access to behind-the-scenes activities some can only imagine. They were allowed to attend some practices and participate in special <abbr>nba</abbr> events. Sonya Curry has jokingly recalled dragging Steph and his siblings off the court during pre-game warm-ups or watching as they ran through the filling arena stands. <span class="mobile-screen">Dell also spoke openly with <abbr title="United States of America Basketball">usab</abbr> during an interview about Steph as a kid and more. You can find link to the article in the Resources section. </span>
          <span class="laptop-tablet-screen"> In 2019 during an interview with <abbr>usab</abbr> when asked about a young Steph Curry. Dell Curry gave the following statement:
            <blockquote cite="https://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2015/05/before-they-made-it-stephen-curry.aspx">
              "He was energetic, always paid attention to what was going on, eager to learn. He tried several different sports, not just basketball. He played football, baseball, a little soccer. He was always very intuitive of what was going on around him. He just soaked it all up." 
              <cite>- Dell Curry</cite>
            </blockquote>
          </span>
          Dell and other members of the Curry family aren't the only ones who have spoken fondly of a young Steph. Several articles and videos of past basketball stars retelling tales of meeting and knowing Steph as a kid can be found online. Several even elaborated on seeing Curry's future potential in the sport. It's safe to say spending his childhood around legends of the game heavily influenced Steph's love for basketball. Through his family's support, love, and encouragement, Steph followed his dream. He worked hard and developed the skills needed to earn a spot on his high school basketball team. He played basketball at Charlotte Christian in North Carolina.

            </figcaption>
          </div>          
          While at Charlotte Christian, he was named to the All-State Team, and All-Conference Team. He also received the team's <abbr title="Most Valuable Player">MVP</abbr> award. Steph helped lead his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. He graduated high school ranked <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 16 in North Carolina  and <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 60 national in his playing position. Yet surprisingly, Curry was not a highly sought-after recruit. He was in his father's shadows. People knew him as "Dell Curry's Son, Stephen Curry" and not just Steph Curry. At the end of his senior year, Steph was only rated as a 3-star recruit. How players are ranked is a highly debated discussion.  The players are ranked 5 to 2, 5 being the highest rating and the lowest a 2. Players are rated against other players across the world. So being rated so low among others did not land him any scholarship offers. Curry had his eyes set on Virginia Tech, He wanted to continue his father's legacy as a Hookie. But after his try-out, he was only offered a walk-on role. However, Steph knew he needed to go to a school where he would be guaranteed playing time if he wanted to make his dreams of going pro come true. It's no secret many colleges overlooked Curry because of his physical appearance. At the end of his high school career, Steph stood at only 6'0 feet tall and weighed under 200 <abbr title="pounds">lbs</abbr>. College basketball is a tremendously cutthroat and physically demanding sport. Several analysts and recruiters deemed his physique unsuitable to meet the demands of the game. However, one college had decided that maybe the analysts were wrong and kept its eyes on him.

          Coach Bob McKillop took notice of Curry during his high school career. He saw something in the young athlete others did not. McKillop saw the potential and high basketball IQ skills Curry possesses. So in the fall of 2006, Curry enrolled at Davidson College. It did not take long for others to see his true potential in the game. <span class="mobile-screen">The <dfn><abbr title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</abbr></dfn> wrote an exceptional piece on Steph's time at Davidson which will be in the resources menu below.</span>
          <span class="laptop-tablet-screen">
            <blockquote class="cited-quote" cite="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2021-08-30/steph-curry-college-basketball-stats-best-moments-quotes#:~:text=First%20all%2Dtime%20in%203,sophomore%3A%204.50%20threes%20per%20game">
              "Nine games into his college career, Stephen Curry has made an impact," wrote The Charlotte Observer's Ron Green Jr. "On a young team that has re-energized Bob McKillop, Curry has emerged not only as the team's primary scoring threat, but as an effective — and potentially outstanding — defender." McKillop agreed with that assessment, noting, "Eventually he'll become one of the great defenders we've had here because he has a great basketball IQ.

          In his freshmen year Steph broke the record for most points(730)scored and most threes(122) in a season by a freshmen at Davidson. He also helped Davidson earn a bid to the 2006-2007 <abbr>ncaa</abbr> Tournament. Sadly the team would lose to Maryland in the first round. Curry finished the game with 30 points. He was named to the <abbr>SoCon</abbr> All-Freshmen team. He won the <abbr>SoCon</abbr> Freshmen of the Year award. He made sure the nation knew his name. His next year at Davidson is one of his most succesful years. Some would say this is the year Steph was able to fully step out of the shadows of his father. He developed his own style of play which set him apart from his father and other players. In the 2007-2008 season Curry once again helped his team make it to the NCAA College Basketball tournament ranked in the 10th spot.

          Curry and the Wildcat team pulled off three major upsets that stunned the nation. They would blaze through the first three rounds against higher ranked opponents, <abbr>No.</abbr>7 Gonzaga, <abbr>No.</abbr>2 Georgetown, and <abbr>No.</abbr>3 Wisconsin. Curry leading the charge with a 40-<abbr title="point">pt</abbr><span>(vs Gonzaga)</span>, 30 -<abbr>pt</abbr><span>(vs Georgetown)</span>, and a 33-<abbr>pt</abbr><span>(vs Wisconsin)</span> games. Davidson was kept out of the Final Four round by a 2 point loss to Kansas. This was the moment Curry put the entire nation on notice. Averaging over 25 points per game and leading his team on what many deemed a cinderella run through the bracket. To top it off Steph would win his fist SoCon athlete of the Year award. This national attention led to numerous articles being written and talk show appearances. Curry would also be nominated for the <abbr>ESPY</abbr>'s Breakthrough Athlete Award. It is safe to say that Curry had put the nation on notice. The next season Steph would move fully into the point guard position. This would be his last season in a Wildcat uniform. Sadly the team didn't make it to The NCAA tournament due to a loss in the <abbr>SoCon</abbr> Finals tournament. However Steph would be NCAA Division I scoring leader. He would also be named to numerous first-team All-American teams. Steph would leave Davidson as the all time leading score record, all time record for 3-pointers, and all record for most 30 and 40 point games. Davidson managed an 85-20 record, only losing eight games a season. Finishing out his junior year Steph owuld decide to become an eligible draftee for the 2008 NBA draft.

The rookie sensation would only just miss winning the Rookie of the Year award finsishing in second place.
